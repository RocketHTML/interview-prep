	A way, especially one of several possible variations, in which a set or number of things can be ordered or arranged.

Input: ("Hello", "Goodbye")  ("timeout", "eioumtt")	("","")
Output:       False		    			True 		   ?


O(nlogn+mlogm)
	sort them
	compare sorted lists for equality
	could use sorted() in python

O(n+m)time O(1)size
	make an ascii int array initialized to all 0s
	iterate through n and increment the ascii indexes of its characters
	when iterating through m, all indicies should be 1, otherwise return false
