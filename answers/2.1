2.1 Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. 
	How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

	a-b-c-u-d-u-e-f

	a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h

 - single or double 
 	- does it matter?


-------------------------------------------------

Without buffer

O(n^2)
compare each element to every element beyond it

-------------------------------------------------

With temporary buffer

O(n)best  O(n^2)worst 
hash table:
iterate through and add to hash table
if position holds a duplicate, remove node
	- collisions cause O(n^2) worst case with linked-list chaining
	- causes a trivial proportion to n with hash table chaining

O(n)
ascii boolean array - if values are all ascii

O(nlogn)
merge sort
if they're sorted, then you don't need (n^2) comparisons
 - but how do you sort a linked list
 - how to preserve the original order
