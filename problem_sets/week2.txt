Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the 'true' length of the string. Example: Input : "Mr John Smith     ", 13; Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. Example: Input: Tact Coa; Output: True (permutations "taco cat", "atco cta", etc.)

Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Write a code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
